# Welcome to LongTrees

LongTrees is an initiative to grow 1000-year-old trees in the City of Edmonton. Through the act of cultivating old trees, we seek to explore the tools, rituals, traditions, artifacts, physical and social structures, and culture(s) needed to support this multi-generational task.

## Our Mission

We believe in creating lasting environmental impact through community engagement. By planting and nurturing trees that will live for centuries, we're not just growing trees – we're cultivating a legacy for future generations.

## Get Involved

Starting with a simple board motion at your community league, you can be part of this transformative initiative. Our documentation provides step-by-step guidance on how to:

1. Pass a board motion
2. Set up a Long Tree Nursery
3. Engage with the community
4. Maintain and nurture your trees
