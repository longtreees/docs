# Tree Distribution and Transplanting

The LongTrees initiative includes both private tree distribution and public tree transplanting programs. This guide outlines the processes and requirements for both.

## Private Tree Distribution (5-10 Years)

Once seedlings reach approximately 6 inches in height (typically 5-10 years), they can be shared with community members. This program helps spread the initiative throughout the community while ensuring proper care and documentation of each tree's journey.

### Distribution Process
1. Assess seedling health and height
2. Document tree history and care requirements
3. Select and prepare community recipients
4. Provide care instructions and documentation
5. Maintain contact information for future tracking

## Public Tree Transplanting (10+ Years)

### The League Tree

One tree from each nursery is designated as "The League Tree." This tree either:
- Remains in the nursery permanently, or
- Gets relocated to nearby League-licensed land once mature

### City Requirements

For trees to be planted on City of Edmonton land, they must meet specific criteria:

#### Size Requirements
- **Coniferous Trees**: Minimum height of 2.5 meters
- **Deciduous Trees**: Minimum 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)

::: warning
For slow-growing species like the Bristlecone Pine, reaching the required height may take several years to decades.
:::

#### Health Standards
Trees must:
- Have good form with proper branch and root structure
- Show vigorous growth
- Be free of pests and disease
- Pass formal inspection by a City of Edmonton Urban Forester

   - Measure tree height/diameter
   - Evaluate health and structure
   - Document growth history

2. **City Approval**
   - Request Urban Forester inspection
   - Submit required documentation
   - Obtain necessary permits

3. **Site Selection**
   - Identify suitable location
   - Check [land licensing requirements](https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/gardens_lawns_trees/request-to-plant)
   - Review [landscaping requirements](https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/COE-IM-GUIDE-0010-v02-20220110DesignandConstructionStandardsVolume5_Landscaping_DSO.pdf)

4. **Transplanting**

   - Follow proper transplanting procedures
   - Document the process
   - Establish care plan
