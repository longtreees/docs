## Role Overview

A Tree Steward is someone who will:
- Care for seedlings and young trees
- Document growth progress
- Build community support
- Ensure succession planning
- Coordinate with the LongTree Society

## Who Should Apply?

The ideal Tree Steward is someone who:

- Has a love for trees and community
- Is interested in long-term thinking and planning

::: tip Stewardship Philosophy
The job of a Tree Steward is to cultivate both trees and long-horizon thinking in your community. You might focus more on one than the other, but the key is ensuring that by the time your job is done, you have a succession plan for yourself and the care of whatever trees you have helping bring into the world.
