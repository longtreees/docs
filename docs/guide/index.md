# Introduction to LongTrees

Welcome to the LongTrees initiative guide. This documentation will walk you through every aspect of participating in the LongTrees project, from initial board approval to long-term tree care and community engagement.

## What is LongTrees?

LongTrees is an initiative to grow 1000-year-old trees in the City of Edmonton. Through the act of cultivating old trees, we explore the tools, rituals, traditions, artifacts, physical and social structures, and culture(s) needed to support this multi-generational task.
