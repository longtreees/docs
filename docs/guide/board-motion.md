# Step 1: Pass a Board Motion

The first step in joining the LongTrees initiative is to pass a board motion at your community league. This page will guide you through the process and provide you with a template motion.

## Overview

Your League Board needs to agree to establish a Mini Long Tree Nursery (25.5' x 25.5') within the boundary of their community building or community garden.

## What is a Long Tree Nursery?

A Long Tree Nursery is a simple raised bed with the following specifications:
- Made from a single eight-foot-long, 2 x 8' board
- Cut into two-foot lengths
- Assembled into a square
- Filled with approximately two cubic feet of soil

::: tip
The LongTree Society will provide detailed plans and support for construction.

## Sample Board Motion

Here's a template motion you can use or adapt for your community league:

```
Whereas [Your League Name] considers it important to support city building at the league level because tree planting creates more equitable, livable, and healthier communities.

We move that [Your League Name] Community League support an initiative to plant long-lived trees in our community by participating in the LongTrees.org Initiative.

The process will involve:
1. Recruiting a Tree Steward to work with the sustainability committee (or another suitable committee like Gardening or Facilities)
2. Initial budget request of up to $100 to cover:
   - Cost of a small tree-growing box
   - Other incidentals

If no money is available, we can proceed without funding and apply for micro grants once we have a Tree Steward in place.

There are no other financial implications.
```

## Rationale

The rationale for this motion is simple but powerful:

> The Best Time to Plant a 1,000-year-old tree is 1000 Years Ago. The Second Best Time is Now. Our league can contribute to creating a culture of being good ancestors and working now to create an abundant future.

## Next Steps

Once your board motion passes:
1. [Set up your Tree Nursery](/guide/nursery-setup)
2. Recruit a Tree Steward
3. Connect with the LongTree Society for support and resources

Make sure to document the date and outcome of the motion for your records and future reference.
