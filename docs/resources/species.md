# Tree Species Guide

This guide provides information about tree species suitable for the LongTrees initiative, with a focus on species that can potentially live for 1000+ years.

## Recommended Species

### Bristlecone Pine (Pinus Aristata)
- **Potential Lifespan**: 4000-5000 years
- **Growth Rate**: Very slow
- **Height**: 20-50 feet
- **Characteristics**:
  - Extremely hardy
  - Drought-resistant
  - Adapted to harsh conditions
  - Distinctive twisted growth
### Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides)
- **Potential Lifespan**: 50-100 years (individual stems), but colonies can live for thousands of years 
- **Growth Rate**: Fast
- **Height**: 40-70 feet (12-21 meters) 
- **Characteristics**:
  - Colonies formed through extensive root systems
  - Heart-shaped leaves with flattened stems, causing leaves to "quake" in the wind
  - Prefers well-drained soil and full sun
  - Often found in large, single-species stands

### English Yew (Taxus baccata)
- **Potential Lifespan**: 2,000-4,000 years 
- **Growth Rate**: Slow
- **Height**: 30-65 feet (9-20 meters) 
- **Characteristics**:
  - Conical shape with reddish-brown, peeling bark
  - Dark green, needle-like leaves
  - Highly toxic seeds and leaves, except for the red aril surrounding the seed
  - Tolerates a wide range of soils and light conditions

### Ginkgo Biloba
- **Potential Lifespan**: 1,000-2,500 years 
- **Growth Rate**: Slow to moderate
- **Height**: 66-115 feet (20-35 meters) 
- **Characteristics**:
  - Distinctive, fan-shaped leaves with a long stalk
  - Golden yellow fall color
  - Can thrive in urban environments, tolerating pollution and compacted soil
  - Known for its medicinal properties and as one of the oldest living tree species
